# Greedy Set Cover

### **Problem Definition**

In the set cover problem, we are given a universe U, such that |U| = n, and sets S1,... ,Sk ⊆ U. A set cover is a collection C of some of the sets from S1,... ,Sk whose union is the entire universe U. Formally, C is a set cover if S Si∈C Si = U. We would like to minimize |C|.
